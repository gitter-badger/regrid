[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/rethinkdb-regrid.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rethinkdb-regrid) [![license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/rethinkdb-regrid.svg)](https://github.com/internalfx/regrid/blob/master/LICENSE) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/internalfx/regrid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/internalfx/regrid)

ReGrid is a method of storing large files inside a RethinkDB database.

### Features

- **Reliable** - Files are replicated across the cluster, benefiting from RethinkDB's automatic failover.
- **Scalable** - Easily store large files in RethinkDB, distributed across the cluster.
- **Consistent** - Sha256 hashes are calculated when the file is written, and verified when read back out.
- **Realtime** - Watch the filesystem for changes and be notified immediately.

The [ReGrid spec](https://github.com/internalfx/regrid-spec) is an open specification free for anyone to implement and use.

## Installation

Supports node v4.0+

```
npm install --save rethinkdb-regrid
```

## TL;DR

```javascript
var ReGrid = require('rethinkdb-regrid')

var bucket = ReGrid({db: 'example'})

// initBucket creates tables and indexes if they don't exist, returns a promise.
bucket.initBucket().then(function () {
  // We are now ready to read and write files

  // Watch a filename for changes
  bucket.watchFilename('/videos/myVid.mp4').then(function (cursor) {
    cursor.each((err, changes) => {
      console.log(changes)
    })
  })

  // Open a write stream to ReGrid
  var dbStream = bucket.upload('/videos/bigvid.mp4')

  // Create read stream from file and pipe it to a ReGrid write stream
  fs.createReadStream('./bigvid.mp4').pipe(dbStream)

  dbStream.on('finish', function () {
    // File is now written to the database

    //Read the file and pipe it to a write stream to save the file back out to the file system.
    bucket.downloadFilename('/videos/bigvid.mp4').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./copy-of-bigvid.mp4'))
  })

})
```

## API Documentation

There are mostly 4 types of operations that can be performed in ReGrid. Most method names start with a prefix that organizes the API.

| Prefix | Description |
| --- | --- |
| upload | Writes a file to ReGrid. This function will return a binary write stream. |
| download | Reads a file from ReGrid. This function will return a binary read stream. |
| list | Lists available files in ReGrid. This function will return a read stream in `objectMode`. |
| watch | Watches files for changes in ReGrid. This function will return a [changeFeed](https://www.rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/changes/). |

### `listRegex(pattern[, options])`

##### Parameters

| key | default | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pattern | *required* | String | A regular expression matched against `filename` |
| options | {} | Object |  Optional parameters listed below |

###### Options

| key | default | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

##### returns

ReadStream in `objectMode`. The stream emits objects, not buffers.

##### Description

Returns a read stream for finding files via regular expression. The stream emits objects as they are found, and can be a long running operation.

You may call `toArray()` on the returned stream to coerce it to an array. This may fail if the result set is very large. You may optionally call with limit to prevent this.

##### Example

```javascript
var videoStream = bucket.listRegex('^/videos/', {limit: 100})

videoStream.on('data', function (video) {
  console.log(video)
})

// OR
bucket.listRegex('^/videos/', {limit: 100}).toArray().then(function (videos) {
  // list the first 100 videos in the `/videos` directory
  console.log(videos)
})
```

| key | default | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| filename | *required* | String | The name of the file. |
| options | {} | Object |  Optional parameters listed below |

###### Options

| key | default | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sort | undefined | String | Sort results by `finishedAt` (The date the file was uploaded). Valid values are `ASC` and `DESC`. |
| skip | undefined | Number | Skip results, useful for pagination. |
| limit | undefined | Number | Limit results. |

##### returns

ReadStream in `objectMode`. The stream emits objects, not buffers.

##### Description

Returns a read stream for finding files by filename. The stream emits objects as they are found, and can be a long running operation. However, this method uses an index and is very efficient.

You may call `toArray()` on the returned stream to coerce it to an array. This may fail if the result set is very large. You may optionally call with limit to prevent this.

##### Example

```javascript
var revisionStream = bucket.listFilename('/videos/editedVideo.mp4')

revisionStream.on('data', function (revision) {
  console.log(revision)
})

// OR
bucket.listFilename('/videos/editedVideo.mp4').toArray().then(function (revisions) {
  // list all revisions of '/videos/editedVideo.mp4'
  console.log(revisions)
})
```

### `listMetadata(metadata[, options])`

##### Parameters

| key | default | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| metadata | *required* | Object | An object to match against the `metadata` field of ReGrid files. |
| options | {} | Object |  Optional parameters listed below |

###### Options

| key | default | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| limit | undefined | Number | Limit results. |

##### returns

ReadStream in `objectMode`. The stream emits objects, not buffers.

##### Description

Returns a read stream for finding files by metadata. The stream emits objects as they are found, and can be a long running operation.

You may call `toArray()` on the returned stream to coerce it to an array. This may fail if the result set is very large. You may optionally call with limit to prevent this.

##### Example

```javascript
var catStream = bucket.listMetadata({topic: 'cats'})

catStream.on('data', function (catVideo) {
  console.log(catVideo)
})

// OR
bucket.listMetadata({topic: 'cats'}).toArray().then(function (catVideos) {
  // list all videos under the 'cat' topic.
  console.log(catVideos)
})
```
